# ACCIDENT-PREVENTION-SYSTEM-USING-ARDUINO-UNO

# Introduction
There has been an alarming rise in road accidents, significantly U-Turn accidents, in Bangladesh over the past few years. The U-Turn remains one of the most dangerous driver strategy on roads worldwide. Paramedics respond daily to severe trauma from crashes that could have been prevented had it not been for the hasty decision to make a U-turn in traffic.

We all know U-turns are illegal most of the time - drivers are putting their own lives and the lives of other road users at serious risk when doing so at the wrong place and in the incorrect manner. In this section we want to focus on the U-Turn in an attempt to create awareness that could prevent many further crashes.
Here is an automated Internet of Things (IoT) based accident prevention system.

Following link contains demo videos of the system:-

# Novelty of the System
Driver will be intimated about ‘accident prone zone’ based on the vehicle's coordinates. Hence , the driver will become cautious while driving.

# Components Required
1. Arduino Uno
2. Jumper Wires
3. Motion Sensor
4. Breadboard (generic)
5. 5 MM LED : Green
6. 5 MM LED : Red

# These connections you have to make in the Arduino UNO (according to the code)
1. Hook the GND pin (Negative Pin) of all led to Pin GND of Arduino.
2. Connect Motion Sensor Pin (Positive Pin) to Pin 3 of Arduino.
3. Connect Red LED VCC Pin (Positive Pin) to Pin 7 of Arduino.
4. Connect Green LED VCC Pin (Positive Pin) to Pin 8 of Arduino.

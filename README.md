# ACCIDENT-DETECTION-SYSTEM-USING-ARDUINO-UNO

# Introduction
Due to increasing number of vehicles on roads, accidents are also increasing, and consequently there have been sharp increase in mortalities caused due to road traffic injury.

# Components Required
1. Arduino Uno
2. Connecting Wires
3. 5 MM LED : Green
4. 5 MM LED : Red
5. 5 MM LED : Yellow
6. Breadboard (generic

# These connections you have to make in the Arduino UNO (according to the code)
1. Hook the GND pin (Negative Pin) of all led to Pin GND of Arduino.
2. Connect Red LED VCC Pin (Positive Pin) to Pin 9 of Arduino.
3. Connect Yellow LED VCC Pin (Positive Pin) to Pin 8 of Arduino.
4. Connect Green LED VCC Pin (Positive Pin) to Pin 7 of Arduino.

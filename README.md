# ACCIDENT-DETECTION-SYSTEM-USING-ARDUINO-UNO

# Introduction
Due to increasing number of vehicles on roads, accidents are also increasing, and consequently there have been sharp increase in mortalities caused due to road traffic injury.My name is Mohsina.

Following link contains demo videos of the system:-

# Novelty of the System
Driver will be intimated about ‘accident prone zone’ based on the vehicle's coordinates. Hence , the driver will become cautious while driving.

# Components Required
1. Arduino Uno
2. Jumper Wires
3. Motion Sensor
4. Breadboard (generic)
5. 5 MM LED : Green
6. 5 MM LED : Red

# These connections you have to make in the Arduino UNO (according to the code)
1. Hook the GND pin (Negative Pin) of all led to Pin GND of Arduino.
2. Connect Motion Sensor Pin (Positive Pin) to Pin 3 of Arduino.
3. Connect Red LED VCC Pin (Positive Pin) to Pin 7 of Arduino.
4. Connect Green LED VCC Pin (Positive Pin) to Pin 8 of Arduino.
